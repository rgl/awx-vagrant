# About

My [Ansible AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) playground.

## Usage (libvirt/ubuntu-22.04)

Install the [Ubuntu 22.04 Vagrant Box](https://github.com/rgl/ubuntu-vagrant).

Review/Modify the [awx.yml playbook](playbooks/project/awx.yml).

Bring up the `awx` vagrant environment (here it takes about 20m to be ready, but YMMV):

```bash
time vagrant up --provider=libvirt --no-destroy-on-error --no-tty
```

Access AWX at the returned endpoint. For example:

http://192.168.121.42:30080

Use the `admin`/`admin` credentials.

Select one of the Templates and click their Launch (rocket icon) button to excute a playbook.

Follow the next section to manually configure AWX in a similar way as the [awx.yml playbook](playbooks/project/awx.yml).

List this repository dependencies (and which have newer versions):

```bash
export GITHUB_COM_TOKEN='YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN'
./renovate.sh
```

### Manual Configure AWX
